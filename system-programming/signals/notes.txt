## Signals
# signals are software interrupts that provide a mechanism for handling asynchronous events
# These events can originate from outside the system, such as when the user generates the
  interupt character by presenting ctrl+c or from activites within the system
# In linux, there are different signals and have a unique numbers, by which they are identified
# signals have a very precise lifecycle. First, a signal is raised, The kernel then stores the signal until it is able
  to deliver it. Finally the signals are delivered to corresponding processs.

# The kernel can perform one of three actions, depending on what the process asked it to do
  - "ignore the signal" : no action is taken
     There are two signals that cannot be ignored; SIGKILL and SIGSTOP
  - "Catch and handle the signal": the kernel will suspend execution of the process's current code path
    and jump to previously registered function. The process will then execute this function once the process
    returns from this function, it will jump back to whenever it was when it caught the singal
  - "Perform the default action": This action depends on the signal being sent.The default acion is often
    to terminate the process

# Every signal will have its default behaviour incase the process has not handled it

## signal identifiers
# every signal has a symbolic name that starts with the prefix 'SIG'. For example, SIGINT is the signal sent when the user processes ctr+can
# SIGKILL is the signal sent when a process is forcefully terminated
# These signals are all defined in a header file included from <signal.h>

# NOTE: every signal has a default action 

## some common signals;
# SIGABRT: the abort() function sends this signal to the process that invokes it. The process then terminates and generated a core dump file
# SIGALRM: the alarm() and setitimer() funtions send this signal to the process that invoked them when an alarm expires
# SIGBUS: (bus error) this signal is raised when a process has a memory access error
# SIGCHLD: whenever a process terminates or stops, the kernel sends this signal to the process's parent
# SIGCONT: the kernel sends this signal to a process when the process needs to be resumed which is in a stopped state
# SIGFPE: this signal represents any arithmetic exception
# SIGILL: the kernel sends this signal when a process attempts to execute an illegal machine instruction
# SIGINT: this is a interrupt signal. This occurs when users presses ctrl+c from keyboard
# SIGKILL: this signal is sent from the kill() system call.
# SIGPIPE: if a process writes to a pipe but the reader has terminated, the kernel raises this signal
# SIGSEGV: this signal, whose name derives from segmentation violation, is sent to a process when it attempts an invalid memory access
# SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2: these signals are available for user-defined purposes, the kernel never raises them. Only user can generate these signal from usermode


"
A core dump file is a file that captures the memory content and state of a process at a specific moment, 
typically when the process crashes or terminates unexpectedly. It is used for debugging purposes to diagnose the cause of the crash.

Key Features of a Core Dump File
Memory Snapshot:

It contains a snapshot of the process's memory (heap, stack, and data segments) at the time of the crash.
Helps developers analyze variable values, memory usage, and pointers.
Process State:

Captures the state of the CPU registers, including the instruction pointer (where the program crashed).
Includes other metadata like thread information and system state.
Triggered by Errors:

Core dumps are usually created when a program encounters a fatal error, such as segmentation faults (SIGSEGV), illegal instructions, or division by zero.
Debugging Aid:

Developers use tools like gdb (GNU Debugger) to analyze core dump files.
By examining the dump, they can determine the source of the issue and fix bugs in the program.

========================

What Are SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2?
Definition:

SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are two user-defined signals provided by Unix/Linux systems.
They are not assigned a predefined behavior (like SIGINT or SIGTERM), so you can use them for custom inter-process communication.
Purpose:

These signals are meant for user-defined actions in your programs.
For example, you can use them to notify a parent process about some event in the child process (like a custom handshake or status update).
Why Use Them?

They give flexibility to send signals between processes without overriding system-defined signals like SIGTERM.
They allow processes to "talk" to each other in a structured way.
Why Use kill() to Send Signals?
The kill() function allows one process to send a signal to another process. It's not just for "killing" processes (despite the name). Hereâ€™s how it works:

kill() Syntax:
$ kill(pid, signal_number);

pid: The process ID to which you want to send the signal.
signal_number: The signal you want to send (e.g., SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2).

NOTE: kill <pid> ~= kill -15 <pid>   // cli based kill
      kill(pid, signal_number)       // code based kill
