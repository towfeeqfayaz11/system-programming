## typedef in c
----------------
typedef in C is a keyword that allows you to create an alias for an existing data type.
This can simplify complex data types, improve code readability, and provide more meaningful
names for various types, especially when working with structures, pointers, or other complex types.

The basic syntax for typedef is as follows:
$ typedef existing_type new_type_name;

e.g;
typedef int Integer;

typedef struct {
    char name[50];
    int age;
} Person; // Creates an alias 'Person' for the struct
